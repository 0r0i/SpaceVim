## Introduction

[SpaceVim](https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim) is a community-driven vim distribution with a bundle of modular configuration,
here we call these modules as layers, each layer has different plugins and config, users just need
to select the layers they need. It got inspired by [spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs). If you use SpaceVim,
please star it on github. It's a great way of getting feedback and gives me the kick to
put more time into development.

If you are new to vim, you should learning about Vim in general, read [vim-galore](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-galore).

## Features

- **Great documentation:** access documentation in Vim with
<kbd>:h SpaceVim</kbd>.
- **Beautiful GUI:** you'll love the awesome UI and its useful features.
- **Mnemonic key bindings:** commands have mnemonic prefixes like
<kbd>[Window]</kbd> for all the window and buffer commands or <kbd>[Unite]</kbd> for the
unite work flow commands.
- **Lazy load plugins:** Lazy-load 90% of plugins with [dein.vim]
- **Batteries included:** discover hundreds of ready-to-use packages nicely
organised in configuration layers following a set of
[conventions](http://spacevim.org/development/).

##### Neovim centric - Dark powered mode of SpaceVim.

By default, SpaceVim use these dark powered plugins:

1. [deoplete.nvim](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim) - Dark powered asynchronous completion framework for neovim
2. [dein.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim) - Dark powered Vim/Neovim plugin manager

TODO:

1. [defx.nvim](https://github.com/Shougo/defx.nvim) - Dark powered file explorer
2. [deoppet.nvim](https://github.com/Shougo/deoppet.nvim) - Dark powered snippet plugin
3. [denite.nvim](https://github.com/Shougo/denite.nvim) - Dark powered asynchronous unite all interfaces for Neovim/Vim8

##### Modular configuration

- SpaceVim will load custom configuration from `~/.local.vim` and `.local.vim` in current directory.
- SpaceVim support `~/.SpaceVim.d/init.vim` and `./SpaceVim.d/init.vim`.


Here is an example:

```viml
" Here are some basic customizations, please refer to the top of the vimrc
" file for all possible options:
let g:spacevim_default_indent = 3
let g:spacevim_max_column     = 80
let g:spacevim_colorscheme    = 'my_awesome_colorscheme'
let g:spacevim_plugin_manager = 'dein'  " neobundle or dein or vim-plug

" Change the default directory where all miscellaneous persistent files go.
" By default it is ~/.cache/vimfiles.
let g:spacevim_plugin_bundle_dir = "/some/place/else"

" By default, language specific plugins are not loaded. This can be changed
" with the following:
let g:spacevim_plugin_groups_exclude = ['ruby', 'python']

" If there are groups you want always loaded, you can use this:
let g:spacevim_plugin_groups_include = ['go']

" Alternatively, you can set this variable to load exactly what you want:
let g:spacevim_plugin_groups = ['core', 'web']

" If there is a particular plugin you don't like, you can define this
" variable to disable them entirely:
let g:spacevim_disabled_plugins=['vim-foo', 'vim-bar']
" If you want to add some custom plugins, use these options:
let g:spacevim_custom_plugins = [
 \ ['plasticboy/vim-markdown', {'on_ft' : 'markdown'}],
 \ ['wsdjeg/GitHub.vim'],
 \ ]

" Anything defined here are simply overrides
set wildignore+=\*/node_modules/\*
set guifont=Wingdings:h10
```


#### Custom configuration
SpaceVim use `~/.SpaceVim.d/init.vim` as default global init file. you can set
SpaceVim-options or config layers in it. SpaceVim also will add `~/.SpaceVim.d/`
into runtimepath. so you can write your own vim script in it.

SpaceVim also support local config file for project, the init file is `.SpaceVim.d/init.vim`
in the root of your project. `.SpaceVim.d/` will also be added into runtimepath.

here is an example config file for SpaceVim:

```viml
" set the options of SpaceVim
let g:spacevim_colorscheme = 'solarized'

" setting layers, load 'lang#java' layer.
call SpaceVim#layers#load('lang#java')

" add custom plugins.
let g:spacevim_custom_plugins = [
 \ ['plasticboy/vim-markdown', {'on_ft' : 'markdown'}],
 \ ['wsdjeg/GitHub.vim'],
 \ ]

 " custom mappings:
 nnoremap <c-l> :Ydc<cr>
```
