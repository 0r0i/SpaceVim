# [Blogs](https://spacevim.org/community#blogs) > Use Vim as a Java IDE

I am a vimer and a java developer. Here are some useful plugins for developing java in vim/neovim.

## Project manager
1. [unite](https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim) - file and code fuzzy founder.

The unite or unite.vim plug-in can search and display information from arbitrary sources like files, buffers, recently used files or registers. You can run several pre-defined actions on a target displayed in the unite window.

The difference between unite and similar plug-ins like fuzzyfinder, ctrl-p or ku is that unite provides an integration interface for several sources and you can create new interfaces using unite.
